#google-homepage project per T_O_P
#From The Odin Poject's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
#we are deconstructing and reconstructing the google homepage int his project
#3/9/17... you took a few days off - here's the plan of attack:
	#1) find img, position it
	#2) create buttons
	#3) css to position everything
#3/15/17 ugh... took a few more days off and forgot some stuff. you need to rebrush up on some html and css stuff
	#you did get the img you needed, you even have the search field layed out, and the two submit buttons created and labeled, but...
	#positioning, positioning, positioning!
#Next steps - brush up on css and html to figure out how to orient your buttons, center everything, and make it prettier
